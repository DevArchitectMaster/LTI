# LTI
examples for synchronous and bidirectional communication between e-learning platfrom (lms) and your own tool


[LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)](http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability "LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)")

Each LTI connection requires an **LTI provider** to deliver the external content and an **LTI consumer** to integrate the external content. Practically, each e-learning platfrom (lms) is an LTI consumer by nature.

Authentication at LTI is realized by means of [OAuth](http://oauth.net/).
